# Introduction

_A lightweight and multivariant React UI library built with customization and consistency in mind_

## Why yet Another React UI Library?

I am glad you are asking this question. I asked this exact same question before I
started building this library. Why can't I just use [Semantic UI](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI-React),
[Material UI](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui), or
[Ant Design](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design)? Yes, I totally can.
That's what I initially tried when building applications. However, I quickly ran
into some problems. For example, I might have to use two UI libraries because library A
doesn't have the feature I want whereas library B does. This will potentially increase
my application final bundle size by a large amount, if Webpack is not configured properly
to make tree-shaking magic working or the libraries depend on too many other modules.
In addition, popular UI libraries are often created by some large companies. On one hand,
these libraries are well managed and qualities can be assured; on the other hand,
they are created following the companies' design languages. For instance, Material UI
is created by Google, thus following Google's material design principles. It doesn't
make much sense for my organization sharing similar user interface and feeling with those
big companies. In the end, I have to open web inspector, inspect every element and override CSS,
to make it feel like my organization's style. Needless to say, this process is tedious

## Why Ztopia UI

Ztopia UI is built with the following principles in mind

- Lightweight: using an UI library generally means we are working with a relatively higher
  abstraction layer, so that we can focus on the application business logic
  instead of internal UI rendering logic. However, libraries such as Material UI
  are created for everyone, which means they need to cover all possible use cases.
  This of course helps them obtain popularity. A downside of this is that they
  become more complex and harder to use. Ztopia UI only focuses on the most essential features
  of UI components. None of them has more than 10 props, which makes them very minimal
  and easy to use

- Multivariant: variants define how UI components look. Even though Ztopia UI
  is lightweight, it doesn't necessarily mean it is lack of exciting features.
  By smartly choosing component variants, we are able to create applications with totally different feelings

- Customization: as I mentioned in the why section, overriding UI component library style to fit
  a particular design language is a very common thing. With this observation in mind,
  Ztopia UI is created with very minimal style, so the library size will be smaller
  and users will have less CSS to override. In addition, Ztopia UI sticks with [CSS BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/)
  methodology and all components are prefixed with `ztopia-`. This also makes it easier
  for library consumers to override CSS

- Consistency: I believe that a consistent API across different components can help people
  get familiar with this library, thus making Ztopia UI even easier to work with. For example,
  you can expect that all boolean props start with `is`, `has`, and etc., which makes them sound like
  a true and false question. If a component is implemented with different looks (e.g. `<Button>`),
  the prop that controls this is called `variant` instead of `type` or `kind`.
  A consistent API helps library consumers observe patterns, thus saving them some time
  when reading documentation

## Technologies

Ztopia UI is built with the following technologies

- TypeScript: yessss! built-in type support if your application is also written in TypeScript

- CSS with BEM syntax

- Rollup: for transpiling and bundling all components

- Docz with Ztopia theme: if you enjoy reading documentation for this library
  and fall in love with tweaking React component props in real time, you should
  definitely check out [Docz](https://github.com/pedronauck/docz) and [Ztopia theme](https://github.com/zicodeng/docz-theme-ztopia),
  which is another open source project I created
