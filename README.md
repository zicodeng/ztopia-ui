_It's not just another UI library. It's an entire world._

Getting tired of viewing your website with just one basic theme across pages? Well, you are not alone. Most UI libraries on the market do not support multiple themes. It has always been time-consuming and challenging for companies to build multi-themed websites. This is why we are creating Ztopia UI, **a React UI library built with multi-theming in mind**. We aim to deliver UI components with easy-to-use API so that you can enjoy different lookings of your awesome websites without any overhead.

### Contributing

Since this is an entirely community-driven and open-source project, we would like you to enlighten us on Ztopia UI design and help us define next theme. You can view our high-fidelity design via **Figma**: https://www.figma.com/file/0nakOv1e6YoVDypM2hkl11iA/Ztopia-UI-Design?node-id=52%3A0

## Development

### Collaboration

-   Always create a new work branch for different features or tasks.
    Name your work branch as your name + feature you are implementing. e.g. `zico-add-starter-code`.
-   Before you create a new work branch, always make sure to pull the latest code and rebase against `origin/master`.
-   Never push your code to master branch directly.
-   Each commit should only concern its own primary task. For example, if you encounter a bug and know a quick fix for it, do not fix it in your current commit. Create a new commit for fixing this bug instead.
-   Always **capitalize** the first letter in your commit message.
-   Use **JSDoc** for module and function comments.
