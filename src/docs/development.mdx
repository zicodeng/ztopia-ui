# Development

## Collaboration

-   Always create a new work branch for different features or tasks.
    Name your work branch as your name + feature you are implementing. e.g. `zico-add-starter-code`.
-   Before you create a new work branch, always make sure to pull the latest code and rebase against `origin/master`.
-   Never push your code to master branch directly.
-   Each commit should only concern its own primary task. For example, if you encounter a bug and know a quick fix for it, do not fix it in your current commit. Create a new commit for fixing this bug instead.
-   Always **capitalize** the first letter in your commit message.
-   Use **JSDoc** for module and function comments.
